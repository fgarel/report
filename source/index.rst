   contain the root `toctree` directive.


.. http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#sections

.. Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters
.. as the structure is determined from the succession of headings.
.. However, for the Python documentation, here is a suggested convention:

.. # with overline, for parts
.. * with overline, for chapters
.. =, for sections
.. -, for subsections
.. ^, for subsubsections
.. ", for paragraphs"
